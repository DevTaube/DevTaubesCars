# DevTaube's Cars
DevTaube's Cars is a Minecraft datapack that adds working cars to the game! \
Cars can be crafted and upgraded to be faster and hold more fuel.


### Spawning a car
Cars can be created using two ways. \
Cars can be crafted by throwing 1 Iron Block, 1 Minecart & 1 Furnace on the same spot on the ground. \
A car can also be summoned using admin commands. \
Simply enter ``/function dtcars:spawn`` into chat to create one at your current location.

### Upgrading a car
Now that you have a car, you want to upgrade it. There are two stats that you can upgrade. \
You can upgrade the maximum amount of fuel a car can hold and the speed the car travels at. \
Maximum fuel can be upgraded by throwing an iron bar inside of the car. \
This upgrade has no apply limit; it can be upgraded as much as you want. \
Travel speed can be upgraded by throwing a redstone block inside of the car. \
The highest speed level that can be applied is ten.

### Fuel
Your car needs fuel to drive. One unit of fuel per second, to be exact. \
If your car lacks fuel it cannot be ridden. \
Supply your car with ten units of fuel by dropping either a charcoal or normal coal into it. \

### Using the car
A car can be ridden by entering it (by right clicking it) and holding a tripwire hook. \
If fuel is supplied the car should now begin to drive foreward. \
Stop the car by taking the tripwire hook out of your hand again. \
After upgrading the speed of your car you propably noticed that your car can be \
a bit too fast at times. Drop the tripwire hook when driving to set the car \
into slow mode. In this mode, the car will drive at the default speed of one. \
Drop your tripwire hook again to exit this mode.

### Removing your car
Tired of your car? Remove it by dropping shears into it. \
This will destroy your shears and give you all the items needed to craft a new car. \
The same will happen if you drive your car into a wall. \
WARNING! The items needed for your upgrades wont be given back.
